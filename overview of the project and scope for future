this project is being made for a greener and cleaner future,the purpose of this project is to develop a solution for any and every street lamp across the world,
IR sensors are used for the purpose so that if someone wants to demonstrate the proof of concept so He/She may be able to demonstrate,the main sensor to be used is microwave proximity sensor but the logic will reain same.
the logic presented is for a double lane system in which one side of the road is reffered to as road1 and the otherside as road2.
three leds are clubbed togather so as to make a single arduino pin for controlling three of them,and the sensors are place so as to save the usage of one sensor by putting it before and after the led segment.
the logic developed in this code is only functional for one vehicle system.
